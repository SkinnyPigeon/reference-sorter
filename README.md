# Reference Sorter

Quick method of alphabetising references as part of a latex project where they follow the following format:

```
Author, I. \textit{Book/Article Title}. Year. Available at \url{domain.com}. Accessed on Day of Year.
\\
\\
```

Copy all titles to a text file, set input and output names in `sort_it.py`, profit!
